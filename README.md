==========

CocosSharp sample game and slides from presentation at Queensland C# Mobile Developers Meetup 10/12/2014.
Relive the meetup with this balloon popping cocossharp sample featuring all the rsvp-ers!

This sample demonstrates:
- App Launch - windows, ios, android
- Scenes and transitions
- Actions and animations
- Sprite loading
- Labels
- Out of the box particle systems
- Touch handling.

By default, the app will use a cached set of rsvp image urls.
For the full experience: 
- Get an API key from www.meetup.com
- Set MeetupConfig.ApiKey in MeetupClasses.cs to your key
- Optionally set MeetupConfig.MeetupEventId to another event id for near infinite variation and replayability.

Slides from the presentation included in pptx and pdf format.
